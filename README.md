Demo
============

[https://main.d86zqfytrsipk.amplifyapp.com/](https://main.d86zqfytrsipk.amplifyapp.com)

The project was tested on desktop and on these mobile devices: Moto G4, iPhone X and iPad Pro.


Installation
============

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) Clone `https://github.com/gtodesco/products-landing-page.git`.
- 1.2) `cd products-landing-page` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with `npm install`.

#### 2) Start

- 2.1) Run `npm run serve` to run a server locally.


Usage
============

The page has the following features:

- The buttons at the top direct users to sections of the page;

- To see more products, click on 'Ainda mais produtos aqui!';

- In 'Compartilhe a novidade', enter a name, a valid email and confirm to see the email layout. (On mobile devices, it may be necessary to zoom out to view the entire contents of the banner).


Technology
============

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node

The use of the <h(x)> tags is an example of the application of semantics in HTML, highlighting more important texts.
In addition, I structured the code with the tags <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <picture>, <footer>.

The styles, with media queries were separated by page and they also have a global style.

The .js files follow the same pattern.

The dependencies used were:

- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server);
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).
